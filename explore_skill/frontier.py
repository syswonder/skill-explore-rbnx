"""Frontier extraction + scoring on nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid.

Standard formulation: a "frontier cell" is a free cell (occupancy=0)
adjacent to at least one unknown cell (occupancy=-1). Cells are
clustered into frontier *groups*, each group represented by its
centroid + size. The controller picks the highest-scoring group as
the next exploration target.

Scoring trades off information gain (cluster size — bigger frontier
= more unknown will become known if visited) against travel cost
(Euclidean distance from robot to centroid as a cheap proxy for the
true planner cost). nav2 / RRT-based explorers use the actual
costmap-aware planner cost, but for the dev demo a Euclidean proxy is
fine and avoids re-implementing A*.

We deliberately don't filter against an inflation halo here — that's
the navigation service's costmap layer's job. If the chosen frontier
is technically unreachable due to obstacle inflation, the nav RPC
will fail with a planning error and the controller picks the next
candidate. Re-doing inflation in this module would duplicate state
and violate the layering rule (frontier finder has no contract
dependency on inflation).
